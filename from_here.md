- data **types** (int, float, bool, string, list, dict, set)
- built-in **keywords** (`def`, `for`, `int`, `list`, `del`, etc)
- boolean logic (truthiness)
- mutable vs immutable data types
- **variables** - decalaration, re-use
- working with **strings** (string concatenation, string formatting, f-strings, lower/uppercase strings)
- **functions** (positional arguments, keyword arguments)
- flow control (`if/elif/else` statements)
- loops (`for` loop, `while` loop, the `break` statement, the `continue` statement)
- working with files (txt, json)
- working with real-life data (covid data, dataset about movies, etc)
- function decorators
- basics of the HTTP protocol; basic usage of the `requests` module (`requests.get(url)`)
- basics of object-oriented programming

## What to learn after the course

### Python

- learn about the unittest module and learn how to use it
- do the challenges on [Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
- find more resources [here](https://samu.space/resources-for-learning-python/)

### Programming in general

- learn about data structures and algorithms [here](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
- (optional) learn about [design patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)
- if you want to go deeper, here is a detailed list of topics that are worth learning about: [what to learn as a developer](https://samu.space/backenddevareas/#programming)

### Tools, technologies

- learn `git`
  - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
  - https://www.atlassian.com/git
  - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

- learn some Linux
  - (if you are using Windows) install Ubuntu on Windows (WSL2)	
  - read about Linux tools like grep, awk, sed, uniq, sort

- learn more about the web and HTTP
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP
  - http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/http-basics/


### Programming as a career

Pros of being a developer


- it can be interesting to delve deep into a technical topic
- it feels like doing "engineering" work, but it's not necessarily heavy on maths
- it feels "technical", but you don't have to fully understand the deeply theoretical stuff behind it
- it can provide some level of good feeling when you learn something new, or you suddenly understand something you didn't get before
- it pays well
- it's flexible (re. time and location)
- there are many job opportunities (after a certain level of experience at least - in the beginning, it might be difficult)
- it feels good when you are on the same page, same wavelength with a coworker, and you can work together efficienly. Eg. the practice of "pair programming" is a more social, more collaborative method for doing programming (https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
- it can be a creative work (usually, at the workplace, you have less space for creativity, but it can be a creative hobby outside of work)
- it can provide work in many different industries, so you get to peek into those industries a little bit
- it can be very complex

Cons

- it can be very complex
- you rarely feel like you have finished something - the work is always ongoing, there is always ongoing development
- it's a huge area and it feels overwhelming and it can feel like you will never learn it properly
- it can feel intimidating and can make you feel slow/unintelligent
- you sit in front of the computer a lot
- you constantly fight with errors - all day, every day
- you can cause a lot of trouble when you mess something up...
